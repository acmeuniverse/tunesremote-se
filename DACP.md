# DACP #

Digital Audio Control Protocol (DACP) is a protocol used by the Apple Remote application (app) on iOS mobile devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch) to control iTunes running on a remote computer.

DACP is similar to the well-known DAAP, using Bonjour MDNS to find libraries, then using HTTP requests with binary responses to transfer data.

These pages contains information either collected from the internet or worked out by myself and are presented in the interests of allowing interoperability.

iTunes is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. This program makes no claim to be either authorized or approved by Apple, Inc. The reverse engineering of DACP doesn't appear to circumvent any protection covered under the DMCA, and is similar to the open-source efforts of the Samba project. This project is simply interested in allowing interoperability.
